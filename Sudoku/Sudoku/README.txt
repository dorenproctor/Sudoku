This is an implementation of the game sudoku for iPhones. Hopefully the interface is straightforward enough to be used without instruction.

Extra Credit:
An alert pops up when you win the game. If you want to quickly test this, you can go into MainMenuViewController and change the variable customGame to be "29416738578645329113598274686729513495234167834187652942361985767952841351873496." and you will get a nearly finished puzzle. You can change it to be any other sudoku game as well if you want.
